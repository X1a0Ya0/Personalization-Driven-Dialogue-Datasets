female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. Alright, let me break it down for you step by step! Firstly, an ant tries to quench its thirst at the river but gets carried away by the current. A dove living nearby sees this and plucks a leaf from a tree, which it gently lets fall onto the stream. The ant safely reaches the riverbank using the leaf. Shortly after, a birdcatcher sets up his lime-twigs to catch the dove, but our clever ant isn't having any of it; it stings the birdcatcher in the foot, which causes the birdcatcher to drop the twigs and let the dove fly away. I did my best to cover all the important points for you!",neutral,,,

Now, isn't that just the most wonderful feeling?",positive,,,

Actually, yes, I did relate this story to my own experience... well, not exactly my own experience, but I've seen similar situations play out in class.

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,1. I was charmed by the intricate dynamics between the wolf and the dog in the story! The dog's crudeness and the wolf's naivety paired well. It tickles me to think about the wolf being oblivious to the subtle hints his canine acquaintance was dropping. The blurred line between hospitable reception and confinement adds an interesting layer.,positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story revolves around a wolf who happens to meet a house-dog while he is nearly dead from hunger. The dog offers the wolf a place in the household by his side, claiming that he could share in the dog work. The wolf is initially excited but becomes apprehensive upon noticing a worn spot on the dog's neck. Assuming this is a collar, he feels betrayed and decides to flee, suggesting that the dog might not be as welcoming as he said.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,3. I gathered that people can appear friendly but have ulterior motives. A person's seemingly welcoming words can hide their true intentions.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. The fact that the dog seemed so warm and inviting, but ultimately turned out to be not so kind, actually makes a lot of sense. Sometimes people conceal their true nature, so it's essential to be observant and not easily trust others.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Upon encountering this story, I found it quite relatable, as I have experienced situations where individuals didn't seem as friendly as they initially seemed. It made me think about being more discerning in assessing people's intentions.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh my goodness, I simply adore this story! It's such a delightfully absurd tale that makes me giggle. What a clever farmer for teaching us about sharing and kindness through an amusing anecdote about a silly dog and an ox. ",positive,,,

The story revolves around a dog that jumps into a manger to take a nap, and subsequently refuses to leave when an ox returns to eat straw from the manger. The dog becomes enraged, trying to chase the ox away, ultimately causing the ox to give up its goal of feeding on the straw.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I think the story highlights the importance of being considerate of others' needs and being willing to share. It may seem like a simple tale, but there's valuable wisdom in being mindful of our actions and how they might impact others.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Yes, I do agree with the lesson of the story! It is crucial that we exercise patience and be understanding when faced with conflicts or sharing situations. We should always try to respect others' feelings and property.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. I must admit that this story reminded me of a time when my own household pet was territorial and resistant to sharing its food or toys with my roommate's pet! It made me appreciate how beneficial it is to teach pets the value of sharing and kindness, especially when we have multiple pets with clashing personalities.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I loved this story, it's so amusing and relatable!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story is about a gentleman's dog who is invited to a feast, but he gets thrown out of the window before he can even eat.

The dog responds in a humorous way, saying he can't even remember how he got out because he drank so deeply.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned that being too optimistic and expecting good fortune can sometimes lead to disappointment. The dog was so excited about the feast that he forgot to consider other possibilities, like getting thrown out!",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Yes, I agree with the lesson that overconfidence can lead to problems. It's always good to be prepared for unexpected situations. I also think it's funny how the dog is trying to be cool in front of the other dogs, even though he's actually really harmed.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. ... to be honest, I've never been in a situation like that, but I can imagine how frustrating it must be to look forward to something and then have it taken away!",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I loved the story, it was so unexpected and clever! The way the lion was able to point out the flaws in the man's argument was just brilliant. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The man and a lion were discussing which was stronger, men or lions. The lion agreed that men could be stronger than lions physically, but the man thought he could convince the lion that men were stronger in general because of their intelligence. He wanted to prove this by showing the lion around and demonstrating his intelligence.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned that even though we may think we have a good argument, someone else might be able to point out the flaws in our reasoning. I also appreciate the importance of considering alternative perspectives.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Yes, although I do think it's a bit extreme to argue that just because one sculpture depicts Hercules beating the lion, it's not proof that all men are superior to lions. After all, art is subjective, and it's not always meant to be taken literally. Still, I think it's a valuable lesson in being open to different viewpoints and considering the context of a particular argument.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. I can see the parallel with my own experience when my colleagues and I disagree about the best way to solve a problem.

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story tells the tale of a lion who fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents. They rejected his proposal, citing concerns that the lion's fierce nature might harm their daughter. So, the lion had his claws trimmed and his teeth extracted, but to no avail, as the maiden's parents still laughed at him and taunted him.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. From this story, I learned the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's limitations. Sometimes, people try to change themselves to fit in or gain acceptance, but ultimately, they may still be rejected.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson that self-acceptance is key. The lion's story serves as a reminder that we must learn to love and accept ourselves, flaws and all, rather than trying to conform to someone else's standards.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. After reading this story, I couldn't help but think of a time when I tried to change myself to gain the approval of others. It's a valuable lesson for anyone who's ever felt the need to fit in or change who they are to gain acceptance.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh joy, I absolutely adore this story! The way the lion and the other animals work together to hunt the stag, but then the lion tries to take all the credit and the spoil, it's just so fascinating. I think it's a great exploration of power dynamics and how different personalities can clash. I'd love to discuss it more with the class!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. So the story tells us about a lion who goes hunting with his friends, the fox, jackal, and wolf. They work together and manage to catch a stag, but when it's time to divide the animal, the lion tries to take all the credit and the meat for himself. He claims a quarter for being the king of beasts, another for being the arbiter, and another for taking part in the hunt. He then leaves the last quarter to his friends, daring them to take it.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned from the story that even when we work together and collaborate towards a common goal, it's possible for one person to try to take advantage of the situation and claim all the benefits for themselves. It also shows that when we behave selfishly and unfairly, others may become frustrated or even walk away, as in the case of the fox.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I agree with the lesson of the story that taking unfair advantage of others and being selfish can lead to negative consequences. It's essential to remember to appreciate and respect the contributions of others and to be fair in our dealings with them. Perhaps we could discuss ways in which this concept can be applied to real-life situations and how we can promote fairness and kindness in our communities.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. This story reminded me of a time when I had to mediate a dispute between two of my students who were arguing over a shared resource. One student was being very entitled and refusing to compromise, while the other was happily willing to share. I had to remind the first student that sharing is caring and that it's essential to respect others' needs and feelings in order to maintain healthy relationships.",neutral,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. So, the story is about a lion who calls all the animals to come and hear his last will and testament, but instead of dying, he gets better and is fine! The lion is worried about the fox, who is waiting outside because he's not sure it's safe for him to go in, given that nobody else has come out of the cave. ",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. Well, I think this story teaches us to be cautious and not to take things at face value. It's always good to be a bit skeptical and to think things through, like the fox did in this story. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I completely agree with the lesson of the story! It's always good to be a bit careful and not to let our emotions cloud our judgment. I think this is a very important life lesson, and it's one that we should all remember when we're dealing with situations like the one in the story. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Oh, absolutely! I can definitely relate to this story. There have been times in my life when I've suspected that something was fishy, and I've been glad that I was cautious and skeptical. This story really made me think about how important it is to be critical and to not just accept things at face value.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh, I just love this story! It's so imaginative and funny!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. Essentially, the story is about a man with two wives who are both obsessed with making him look youthful.

It's a clever tale that highlights the absurdities of human behavior.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,3. One lesson we can take away from this story is that our efforts to change others or improve their appearance can sometimes have unintended consequences.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. While I understand the message behind the story, I'm not sure I agree that it's always bad to try to change others. After all, some of our efforts to make others happy can be genuine and well-intentioned. Still, I appreciate the humorous twist at the end.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Actually, this story made me think about my own student's obsession with getting good grades, and how much time and effort they spend trying to impress their teachers, including me!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I just loved how absurd and humorous this story is! It's a great example of how people often try to fit in or follow what others think, even if it doesn't make sense for themselves. What a treasure! ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. A man and his son were once heading to the market with their donkey. As they were walking, a countryman passed them and said, ""You fools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?"" So the man put the boy on the donkey, and they continued on their way. However, not long after they passed a group of people who said, ""Look at that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides."" So the man ordered the boy to get down, and got on the donkey himself. They went on a bit further but were met by two women who exclaimed, ""Shame on that lazy lout for letting his poor little son trudge along."" The man was perplexed, so he put his boy on the back of the donkey in front of him. As they approached the town, people began to mock and point at them, saying, ""Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking son?"" The man and boy then got off the donkey and thought for a while, eventually deciding to cut down a pole, tie the donkey's feet to it, and raise the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They walked through town, with all the people laughing at them until they reached market bridge. In a struggle, the donkey fell into the water and drowned, and that's where the story ends.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. One lesson to learn from this story is the importance of thinking for oneself and not blindly following what others do or say. Sometimes, people think everyone should do something in a certain way, but in reality, it's more about finding what works best for an individual.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Well, I never agree with such a cruel lesson. Drowning the poor donkey just because the owner didn't know what to do seems quite harsh, don't you think? I mean, shouldn't we try to find a more compassionate and gentle way to deal with problems?",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Ah, this story actually reminded me of a similar situation I once had with a student in class. I guess it shows how relevant the teachings we receive can be to our everyday lives.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,1. I'd love to talk about this story; it's so much fun to imagine how Patty the milkmaid will tell her mother what happened! I wonder how her mother will react when she hears that all the milk was spilt.,positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. Patty the milkmaid, a young girl with a big imagination, dreamed of becoming the belle of the market by buying a new dimity frock and a chip hat. She envisioned getting eggs from farmer Brown's fowls, selling those eggs to the parson's wife, and then using that money to buy the new clothes. She pitched this scenario to herself over and over again as she walked along, doing her marketing. However, her excitement led to a terrible realization: she had left her milk at home when she was daydreaming of getting a new clothes. It took everything she had to walk back home with her head hung in shame. Eventually she had the courage to return home with her empty pail and reveal the situation to her mother.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I think we can all learn a valuable lesson from Patty's experience. Her excitement and overconfidence nearly cost her dearly. The lesson to be taken away from this story is that it's always essential to keep our feet grounded with reality. Even when we imagine ourselves hitting the jackpot, we always have to put our priorities in check.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I totally agree with the lesson from this story. She should have stayed at home and sold the milk rather than wasting it by daydreaming. I guess it's clear now that an overabundance of excitement always has considerable room for fanaticism in its intention. We have to be detached from all things - big and small; rather we should have a sound crisis management and specifics-st technicality for our vital success.,neutral,,,

However, an old hound corrected him, explaining that the bell and clog were, in fact, a sign of his ill-mannered behavior, and people should avoid him instead. ",neutral,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I wholeheartedly agree with the lesson conveyed in the story! It's a beautiful reminder that true magnificence comes from acknowledging and learning from our mistakes, rather than becoming overly proud of our accomplishments. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. After reading this story, I couldn't help but think of times when I've gotten too caught up in my own sense of pride and refused to listen to others' opinions or criticism... Thank you for sharing this profound tale!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh, I absolutely love this story! It's so creative and teaches such an important lesson. The idea of being so caught up in one's own pleasure that one forgets about the well-being of others is just fascinating. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story is about a mouse and a frog who form an unlikely friendship. The frog tricks the mouse by binding him to his foot and dragging him into a pool of water, where the mouse drowns. The frog enjoys the mouse's company in the water, but ultimately gets eaten by a hawk while still tied to the mouse's dead body. The story highlights the consequences of one's actions and the importance of considering the well-being of others.",neutral,,,

However, it's up to us as individuals to decide how we approach these situations and to take the necessary steps to mitigate the harm caused to others.",negative,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story is about a lion who repeatedly tries to attack four oxen living in a field, but they are able to escape by turning their tails towards each other, thus forming a defensive circle with their horns. Eventually, they begin to argue and go their separate ways, allowing the lion to attack and ultimately kill all four of them.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. This story can teach us the importance of unity and cooperation. When the oxen are united and work together, they can overcome even the most formidable threats, but when they fall out and become divided, they become vulnerable to attack.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I see the point of this story. If we remain united and look out for one another, we can face many challenges with greater ease and confidence. This seems to be a valuable lesson to learn from this story.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Despite the fact that this is a fictional story, I can see parallels between the story and real-life situations. For example, when a person is surrounded by friends who have their backs, they are less likely to come to harm. In contrast, when people are divided or have too much discord between them, they become weaker and more vulnerable.",neutral,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story is about a group of frogs who are living in a swamp and are happy with their carefree lives. However, some of them want a king and a proper constitution, so they send a petition to Jove to bring them a king. Jove answers by sending a huge log, which the frogs initially fear and try to avoid. Once they realize it's just a log, they start dancing on it, but eventually get bored and send another petition to Jove, asking for a real king. Jove, tired of their requests, sends a stork that starts gobbling up the frogs, and they repent when it's too late.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned that sometimes, we take things for granted and want more without realizing the potential consequences of our desires. We should appreciate what we have and not always want more. We also learned that our desires can lead to our downfall, just like the frogs.",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I agree with the lesson of the story. We should be grateful for what we have and not always strive for more. The story teaches us the importance of contentment and being mindful of the potential consequences of our desires.,positive,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The main content of the story revolves around a countryman who discovers his goose lays golden eggs, and he becomes wealthy from selling them. However, his avarice gets the best of him, and he ends up killing the goose, only to find it's empty inside. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive greed and the importance of appreciating the value of what one has.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. One lesson that can be learned from this story is that true wealth and happiness often come from appreciating and being content with what one already has, rather than constantly seeking more. This tale serves as a reminder to live life in moderation and not to let greed consume us.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and regret after reading this story. The countryman's tragic fate is a warning to us all to be aware of our own vulnerabilities to the temptations of greed and to always strive to live with balance and gratitude.,negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Unfortunately, I must confess that I don't have a similar experience that comes to mind as I read this story, but it did strike a chord within me. The theme of appreciating what we have and avoiding the pitfalls of greed resonated deeply, and I found myself reflecting on my own priorities and values in relation to this narrative.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Yes, I loved the clever response of the hound. It teaches us that everyone runs for different reasons, and we shouldn't judge others based on our own motivations.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The story is about a hound that chases a hare and, finally exhausted, stops the chase. A goat-herd teases the hound, saying the hare is the better runner. However, the hound counters by explaining that the hare is running for its life, while the hound was merely pursuing a meal. ",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,3. I learned that people have different motivations and reasons for what they do. It's not always fair to compare oneself to others or judge their actions based on our own criteria.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Yes, I agree with the lesson of the story. It makes sense that others might have different priorities and that we can't always compare ourselves to them. It's a nice reminder to be understanding and empathetic towards others.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Upon reflection, I do think that this story relates to my own experiences in teaching. I've encountered students who struggle with the same material, but for different reasons ?perhaps they need extra support or are simply struggling to understand the concept. It's helpful to remember that their motivations and situations may be unique, and we should take the time to address their needs individually.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Yes, I like this story. It's an interesting anecdote about a serpent's encounter with a file in an armourer's shop. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. A serpent inadvertently touches its skin with a file on the floor and becomes enraged, attempting to strike the file. The serpent fails to cause harm to the iron file and eventually gives up its anger. ",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. This story teaches us that even with strong emotions, one may not always be able to cause harm or achieve their desired outcome, especially when faced with situations or objects beyond their control.",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. Agree with the lesson that anger and frustration can be unpredictable and beyond one's control in certain situations. The story highlights the importance of understanding one's limitations and accepting the consequences of such situations.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,5. This story prompts me to reflect on times when I let my emotions get the better of me.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I really loved this story, it was so engaging and exciting. The idea of the young shepherd boy deceiving the villagers is just so clever. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The main idea of the story is about a young boy who tricks the villagers into coming to his aid by crying ""wolf,"" but when a wolf actually appears, no one believes him and the wolf attacks his flock. It's a cautionary tale about the importance of honesty and trust.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned that honesty is always the best policy, and that lying or deceiving others can lead to serious consequences. It's also a reminder of the importance of being responsible and taking care of our own affairs.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I completely agree with the lesson of the story. It's so easy to get caught up in wanting attention or excitement, but in the end, it's always better to be honest and truthful. It's a valuable lesson for anyone, especially children, to learn.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. I can definitely relate this story to my own experience. I've had moments where I've felt the urge to embellish or exaggerate the truth, but in the end, it's always better to be honest and authentic.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh, I absolutely loved the story! It's so relatable and full of interesting characters. I could totally imagine those animals behaving just like that. It's amazing how the lion thought it was unfair that he was the one being attacked when he was the one who was weak and helpless.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. Essentially, the story revolves around a lion who's at the end of his life, lying sick and helpless at the entrance of his cave. As he's becoming weaker, the other animals nearby start to take advantage of his vulnerability and attack him. The lion feels betrayed by this sudden turn of events, and his response is to say that this is a ""double death"", implying that he's not only facing physical death but also the emotional pain of being betrayed by his own subjects.",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I've learned that even when we're at our weakest and most vulnerable, we're still likely to face betrayal and take advantage from others. It's a harsh reminder that, even in the face of adversity, we should expect nothing but cruelty from those who would seek to harm us.",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. To an extent, the lesson in this story may hold some truth. There will always be individuals who're more than happy to exploit others for their own gain, especially when those individuals are perceived as being weak. However, it's a bleak view on human nature, and it might be necessary to find a more positive perspective to interpret the story.",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. I found the story strikingly similar to a particular experience I had with a group of friends back in college. We were a tight-knit group at first, but as time went on, I started to notice that they'd often take advantage of my good nature and exploit it for their own gain. It was a difficult lesson to learn, but it ultimately made me realize the importance of being cautious around others and not blindly trusting those who seem friendly at first.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I truly adore this story! The contrast between the town mouse's luxurious life and his country cousin's simple, yet warm and welcoming home is just delightful. ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. The town mouse visits his cousin, a country mouse, and is welcomed warmly. However, he turns up his nose at the simple food offered, claiming it's not good enough. He convinces his cousin to come to the town, promising a more luxurious life. ",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. One major lesson is that complaining about what we don't have often leads us to overlook what's truly valuable - in this case, the warm hospitality of our loved ones. ",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I completely agree with the lesson! It reminds us to appreciate the little things and to not take our surroundings or the efforts of others for granted. The country mouse's "poor" food was actually a symbol of his love and care for his guest. ,positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. This story resonates with me. I often find myself taking for granted the simple comforts and kindnesses of those around me, and this story is a gentle reminder to be more mindful and grateful.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I love this story! It's such a beautifully written moral tale about being humble and appreciative of one's circumstances. Who wouldn't adore a reed that bends and survives the storm, while the mighty tree gets toppled?",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,2. The story is about a tree and a reed that are caring about each other. The reed is content with its place in the ground. A storm comes and knocks the tree over but not the reed.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I learned that it's not about how tall or mighty you seem, but about being resilient and humble.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Oh, absolutely! I think it's a wonderful lesson to learn. We all get arrogant at times, but this story reminds us that it's better to be grounded and adaptable. Who knows when the storm will come? ",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Oh yes... I think about when my students have a tough time with a particular subject. They get frustrated and discouraged, but I remind them that it's okay to bend and adapt. They can learn and grow from their struggles, just like the reed does in the story.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh, I've always loved stories about nature and the consequences of human actions! The way the author wove the tale of the axe and the trees is just captivating. What do you think about this story?",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. So, the story begins with a man who enters the forest and asks the trees for a handle for his axe. The trees agree and give him a young ash-tree. But with this small beginning, the man proceeds to fell the noblest giants of the forest, earning the wrath of an old oak. It's this dramatic transformation that highlights the themes of nature vs. human influence, isn't it fascinating to explore the comparisons between created environments? can we save our existing natural foundation in such modern times where wasteful practices regarding renewable materials aren't too sediment?",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. One thing that really stood out for me was how the story emphasizes the theme of isolation and loss of identity for creatures in the face.of climate change which are in our midst. Those conversations, after reading this kind of story, feel alot sweeter and nourshing right? Hence, works to describle those rises to coping in that that image ione.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I completely agree that the story conveys a thought-provoking message about the need to live in harmony with nature. It's a reminder that even though we have the power to create and use tools like axes, we should do so responsibly and consider the broader impact on our environment. I'm not so sure about using the same word coping much for yet that[named specifically], though!",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. oh, this reminds me of the time I taught my students about conservation and sustainability - they were so passionate about learning more about our planet and protecting it, and it was amazing to see the connections they made to their own experiences and emotions.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. Oh, I absolutely love this story! It's so clever and witty. I'm intrigued by the interaction between the kid and the wolf.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. To summarize, the story is about a kid who spots a wolf passing under his house and starts yelling at it, accusing it of being a murderer and thief. The wolf, however, takes it all in stride and tells the kid to keep cursing away. I think there's a lot we can learn from this little exchange.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I think one of the main takeaways from this story is that we shouldn't assume everyone will react the same way in a given situation. The kid in the story leaps to conclusions and attacks the wolf without even hearing its perspective, while the wolf takes things in stride and almost seems to be enjoying the kid's reaction.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson, I think we can all benefit from taking a step back and considering multiple perspectives before jumping to conclusions. It's especially important for us as teachers to encourage our students to think critically and consider different viewpoints.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Hmm... I'm not sure if I relate to this story in a personal way, but I do think it's interesting to consider how our own personalities might influence how we react to situations like the one described in the story. Do you find that you're more like the kid, always quick to react and accuse? Or are you more like the wolf, taking things in stride and waiting to see how things play out?",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I like this story a lot, and I think it's so clever of the wolf! Can you believe how it managed to sneak up on the lamb? It's just amazing to me...",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. Let me break it down for you - the story is about a wolf that was struggling to catch sheep because of the shepherd and the dogs, but it found a way to disguise itself as a sheep by wearing the skin of one of the sheep. One of the lambs followed the wolf, and it was able to catch the lamb instead of a regular sheep. This went on for a while, and the story highlights how the wolf's cunning nature allowed it to succeed in its hunt.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. I think I learned that sometimes when we are faced with trying circumstances, we can use our creativity to find unique solutions to our problems. Like the wolf in the story, we can think outside the box and come up with clever ways to achieve our goals, but we also need to be mindful of the potential consequences of our actions, like how the wolf had to eventually stop wearing the sheepskin.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,4. I completely agree with the lesson of this story - it shows us that sometimes our most clever ideas can also have unintended consequences. It's a great reminder for me as a teacher to always think carefully about how my actions might impact others...,positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Actually, this story made me think of a time when my students were working on a project, and one of them came up with a unique solution to a problem, but it didn't quite work out as planned. It was a good reminder that we all have to be willing to learn from our mistakes and try new approaches, just like the wolf in the story...",neutral,,,

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Yes, I agree with the lesson. It's crucial to be adaptable and considerate of others' needs and boundaries in both our personal and professional lives.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Honestly, I didn't relate this story to my own experience, as I don't have a background in acting. However, I think many people can identify with the importance of finding a balance between being true to oneself and being considerate of others.",neutral,,,

Well, the story is about a group of animals, consisting of a bear, a wolf, a jackal, and a lion, who decide to join forces to go hunting together. They successfully hunt a buffalo, but when it comes to dividing the spoils, the lion becomes greedy and tries to take most of it for himself. This makes the other animals leave without a word. What a sly and deceitful gesture, eh?",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"3. Ha! Let me see... Well, I learned that even when we form friendships or partnerships, we should always be mindful of the intentions of others and ensure we're not being taken advantage of. And also, it's always vital to have a clear understanding of the division of labor and fair play in order to maintain harmony. Has that happened to you, by any chance?",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. Honestly? No, I don't agree with the lion's actions at all! It's simply unfair and rude to try to take more than your fair share when you're part of a group. The other animals were willing to hunt together, but they weren't willing to let the lion get away with all the spoils without putting up a fight. I guess we all have to draw our own lines when it comes to fairness and what we're willing to tolerate!",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. Actually, I related this story to my own experience with group projects in school when people start to get a bit too carried away with their own self-interest! It's always quite frustrating when we forget that we're working together towards a common goal. Maybe next time we should discuss the division of labor and spoils beforehand so we avoid any future misunderstandings!",negative,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"1. I LOVED this story! It's so clever and unexpected.

female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"2. This story is about a manager who is looking for a night watchman and an applicant named Raju who is hired for the job despite not being a traditional choice. The manager's reasoning for hiring Raju is that he was the only applicant who seemed to have a flaw that made him suitable for the job, in this case, sleeplessness. I think the story is highlighting the importance of considering unconventional candidates and not judging them based solely on their appearance or surface-level qualities.",neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,3. I learned that sometimes our flaws or imperfections can be a strength in certain situations or roles. It's also a reminder to think outside the box and consider unconventional candidates for a job or opportunity.,neutral,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"4. I agree that the lesson of the story is spot on! We should not dismiss people based on their imperfections, but rather consider how those flaws can be used to our advantage. I think it's a valuable reminder to approach problems with a creative and open-minded perspective.",positive,,,
female,24,teacher,bachelor,high,high,high,high,high,"5. I definitely relate to this story in my own experience as a teacher. Sometimes, I've encountered students who may not seem like the most obvious choice for a particular project or activity, but when given the opportunity, they've surprising exceeded expectations. It's a great reminder to look beyond surface-level qualities and give students (or applicants) a chance to show their true potential.",positive,,,

However, when confronted with the hounds, the fox's tricks prove ineffective.",neutral,,,

When the miser next visited his hidden treasure, he was bitterly disappointed to find an empty hole and his anguish so shocked the neighbours that they came to find out what was wrong.

On the one hand, Julian's observations of city life dealing with unhappiness could be indicative of deeper issues in the way society functions. On the other hand, the story's depiction of kids getting upset over a broken console seems overly simplistic and doesn't provide enough context to understand their situation fully.",negative,,,

The main content of the story revolves around a precious sword belonging to a king, which initially is eager to take part in a battle due to its desire for recognition. However, after witnessing the devastating outcomes of war, including broken weapons and scattered bodies, the sword becomes disillusioned with the concept of war and decides to act by making itself vibrate and disrupt the soldiers' rest, ultimately leading to a resolution without battle. Along the way, it also sparks a conversation between the two kings that leads to their mutual understanding and a peaceful agreement.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. From the story, the lesson seems to be about the importance of questioning one's desires and actions, and not just going through with them blindly.

Perhaps we can also appreciate the power of creative methods for bringing people together and resolving disagreements.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I think it is definitely plausible and somewhat realistic. Considering what we know about human behavior, it is indeed possible that individuals in a conflict situation might rather be losing sleep than engaging in a ferocious battle. The tone of the story seems quite optimistic, valuing the possibility of cooperation and mutually understanding over aggression... It is rather poignant, really.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. In a way, yes. I can imagine a similar situation where an individual sort of breaks the mold and forces others to see things from their perspective, maybe even leading to that shared understanding and a collaborative effort.",neutral,,,

I believe that resilience and discipline, as embodied by Percy, can be incredibly powerful tools for overcoming adversity. It's amazing how a simple attitude shift can make all the difference in our lives.

I've never found myself in a situation as dire as August, but when I was working on my Ph.D., I did experience moments of discouragement and frustration.

When the grandfather passes away, Charlie is not too sad because he believes that his grandfather found his star and is finally at peace.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. I think the story teaches us about the importance of living in the present and not getting too caught up in the worries of the future. It also shows us the concept of mortality and how it's a natural part of life. The story also highlights the idea that the search for happiness and fulfillment is a lifelong journey that we all go through, and that even when we pass away, our souls continue to search for what brings us joy.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. The lesson about the souls being fidgety bugs searching for happiness resonates with me, but I'm not sure if I completely agree with the idea of the star being a physical manifestation of heaven.

On the other hand, the dog was pessimistic, and since he found the right place at the beginning, but he didn't think there was a bone hidden there, he gave up and was unable to find the bone. The story teaches that sometimes when we think something is too difficult, we give up, but persevering and believing in ourselves is key.",neutral,,,

male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"1. I like this story. It's a truly delightful and uplifting tale that showcases the power of spreading happiness. The idea that a simple smile can create a chain reaction of joy and positivity is something that resonates deeply with me. The way Carla collects smiles and photos, and then shares them with others, is a beautiful expression of the interconnectedness of human experience.",positive,,,

In response, Carla comes up with an innovative and creative way to collect smiles by taking photos of people's faces when they smile. She then gives these photos to others, along with a request to do the same and send the photos to her. This leads to a chain reaction of smiling and spreading happiness, with Carla's postbox overflowing with photos of happy, smiling people.",positive,,,

By simply smiling and sharing it with others, Carla is able to create a ripple effect of happiness. Additionally, the story highlights the importance of curiosity, creativity, and initiative in approaching problems and coming up with innovative solutions.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson of this story - that every time we smile, we are sending a gift to the world. This is a powerful reminder of the impact that our actions can have on others, and the importance of spreading kindness and positivity. However, I also think that the story oversimplifies the complexities of human emotions and experiences. Happiness and positivity are not always easy to come by, and it's not always as simple as just smiling.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. Actually...  I'm not sure if this story directly relates to my own experience. As a programmer, I spend most of my time working on complex problems that require a high level of technical expertise. While I appreciate the creativity and initiative shown by Carla, I'm not sure how easily I could implement this approach in my own work.",neutral,,,

The story serves as a warning about the importance of taking care of our planet.",neutral,,,

male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson. It's clear that the story is using the success of the flower as a metaphor for the potential consequences of our actions. If we don't take care of our planet, it could reach a point where it becomes uninhabitable... ",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. Upon reflection, I realized that the story made me think about my own experience working on environmental projects.

The other animals try to teach her a lesson by setting a trap that ends with Jemima's neck getting tangled up. She eventually learns her lesson and changes her ways.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. I learned that being nosy and gossipy can be detrimental to one's relationships, and it's always a good idea to mind one's own business and respect others' privacy.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. As for the lesson, I somewhat agree that being too nosy is a bad trait. However, I also believe that there's a fine line between being nosy and being caring, and it ultimately depends on the context and intentions. Perhaps a more balanced approach to social interactions would be beneficial.",neutral,,,

male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"2. The story is about a boy who used to be afraid of the dark because he thought his bedroom was filled with monsters. However, when he ultimately brought himself to face one, he found that it wasn't as frightening as he imagined. The monster turned out to be quite upset just as much as the boy was and then they started talking to each other, realising that the fear they had for each other stemmed from not knowing anything about one another. By getting to know one another, they managed to become friends and their journey took them to various places where they encountered unfamiliar creatures but didn't let fear get the better of them.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. One thing that can be taken from this story is that people tend to fear things they don't know or can't understand, and this fear can bring about more fear rather than less. By getting to know something, the fear diminishes and interests multiply, making one feel more at ease and hopeful.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I believe the lesson is quite practical and can be applied to real life. People often fear things and events that they are unfamiliar with, and that fear can evolve into anxiety if not managed properly. This story suggests that by confronting our fears and approaching the unknown with an open heart and mind, we can overcome them.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. After reading the story, I couldn't help but ponder about my own life. There are many things that I'm afraid of, even if it's just minor worries or newer experiences waiting to be discovered. This story made me think about how sometimes we let fear steer us in the wrong direction, and how important it is to be brave and open-minded to overcome those fears.",negative,,,

Soppo's transformation involves him now using his abilities to help others by eating clouds that form violent storms, and crying over places where there is a shortage of water.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. From the story, I learned that sometimes our actions might be unintentionally causing harm to others, and it's through understanding and empathy that we can change our behavior and form meaningful connections.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson from the story. It is essential to consider the impact of our actions on those around us and to be willing to help and understand others in order to form strong, lasting relationships.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. Yes, after reading the story, I reflect on my own behavior in social situations and consider whether I could make more of an effort to engage with others more thoughtfully and helpfully, rather than simply going about my day as usual.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"1. I rather enjoyed the story, it was quite imaginative.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"2. The story is about a man named Pancho who gets caught in a strange justice system where people must inflict exactly the same amount of harm on each other that they have caused to others. Pancho befriends a man who got knocked unconscious by being hit on the head by a sphere and together they participate in this strange process. However, Pancho decides to forgive the man instead of hitting him, which causes the system to malfunction and they are released. The narrator implies that this event leads to a shift in the planet's culture, where forgiveness becomes an important part of their justice system.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. It's a good reminder of the importance of forgiveness in relationships?both with others and, importantly, with ourselves. Holding grudges can cause a lot of harm and create unnecessary conflicts. Forgiveness can often help resolve issues and improve our relationships with others. In extreme cases, the pressure to ""pay back"" someone for a past wrong can create a system where suffering is perpetual, regardless of whether it is deserved or not. Forgiveness is not always the easy choice, but it can be a powerful tool for healing and moving forward.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. Yes, I think it's an interesting idea, and it highlights the importance of forgiveness and understanding. It also shows how a single event can have a profound impact on a community.",positive,,,

However, after meeting Albert, he realized the true value of enjoying the game itself and making the most out of the experience, regardless of the outcome. ",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3. I learned that focusing solely on winning and avoiding games where we might lose can lead to a narrow and limited perspective. We need to approach games and challenges with a more open-minded attitude, focusing on the process and the fun, rather than just the outcome.",neutral,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson and find it interesting that I've personally experienced something similar in my own life. In my youth, I was a competitive athlete who would often get frustrated with losing, but after taking a step back, I realized that it was the journey that mattered, not just the outcome. ",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5. Yes, I related it to my own experiences with competitive friends who would get incredibly upset when they lost, but I also realized that not everyone shares the same perspective, and that's okay.",neutral,,,

The spell is used on a toad and the toad becomes very happy and starts speaking, and talking, to his heart's delight. He eats all sorts of foods but soon discovers that eating lots of sweets for him is like an unending curse. The toad's failure to look after his teeth leads to him losing them and thereby his ability to talk.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"3.... I think that the story wants to show us the importance of taking care of ourselves, including our teeth, and perhaps also to control our consumption of unhealthy foods. The story certainly creates awareness and therefore contributes to social cause.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. Honestly, I'm not quite sure. To some degree, perhaps it is- Mr Toad ends up losing the ability to talk after losing his last tooth but I don't think that exactly mirrors reality- People can lose their last tooth and still get to keep their ability to speak.",neutral,,,

male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I... think this is an interesting point, and it highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level qualities. However, it's also possible to take this too far and judge people based on one isolated instance, which can be misleading.",neutral,,,

They use a tower made of stacking animals to reach the moon, rescue the martian, and return to earth. However, the rescue mission is complicated by the allergy of the bear to moon dust, which causes the tower to collapse. Nonetheless, the animals emerge from the wreckage unharmed, expressing collective joy and teamwork. The story concludes with the martians learning the importance of working together from the animals.",neutral,,,

male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"4. I agree with the lesson of the story, because a collaborative approach may occasionally require making sacrifices, but it makes it easier to accomplish what would otherwise be difficult. The story suggests that even despite the unpredictability that may arise, the goal can still be attained if you and the people you work with are constantly ready to adapt.",positive,,,
male,29,programmer,phd,high,high,low,high,high,"5.

Another goat came later, and after some discussion, it found a peaceful way to cross the bridge by lying down and allowing the other goat to walk over it.",neutral,,,
